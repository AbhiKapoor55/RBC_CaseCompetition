  "Good Afternoon! How is your day going?",
  "When are you going to be starting to work?",
  "What type of car are you thinking of?",
  "An S3 Sedan costs $53,590. Insurance would be $2,100, plus $120 for registration. Where would you be commuting to?",
  "That is 38.5 kilometers from your house...so an additional $50 for gas every week.",
  "Based on cross-data, the average person your age spends $12.5 a day on parking downtown.",
  "Let me take a look at your expense history..... I noticed you spend $58 dollars more than usual last month on coffee, and $120 more than usual on eating out.",
  "Also, it seems that three quarters of people in your age group start looking for housing within 5 years of starting full time work. Do you think that you will need a house in 5 years?",
  "That is a lot of money to spend then! Let us think about some alternative options: Using public transport, or buying a used car! How about this one: https://www.autotrader.ca/a/audi/a3/mississauga/ontario/5_46305399_20110928101251178/?showcpo=ShowCpo&ncse=no&ursrc=pl&urp=5&urm=8&pc=M4B%201B5&sprx=100 ",
  "To reach this goal, you must reduce your coffee spendings to $23 a month! And limit take-out to $42 a month :("

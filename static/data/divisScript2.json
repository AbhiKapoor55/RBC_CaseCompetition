	"Hey Abhi, do you want to hear a good deal I have for you?", 
	"I notice you have 5,000 points accumulated on your RBC reward program and you haven’t used it so far. 2,000 points will expire by the end of this month, so it would be a good idea to start planning redeeming it."  
	"Also, based on your historic spendings, I suspect this is time for you to plan that special dinner with your love on Valentine’s Day."
	"Are you still with me?", 
	"Based on what I know from your habits, I know that you appreciate japanese food. We have a partnership with Kasa Moto and I assume this is one of your preferred one, right? You have been there a couple of times. On this special offer, you can redeem 3,000 points for a dinner for two.", 
	"If it does not make sense for you, your peer clients are also giving good reviews from Kinka Izakaya. You can redeem the same 3,000 points for a dinner for two. If it does not work, let me know what is your need and I can help you find a good deal and not losing your points.", 
	"Awesome! Do you confirm we can redeem 3,000 points for a dinner at Kasa Moto?", 
	"Cool. I will send you all the details by email. Have a nice day!"
